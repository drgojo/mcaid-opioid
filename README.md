# Medicaid Opioid Prediction
This project uses a medicaid dataset to create features and model risk of progression from acute to chronic opioid use in an opioid naive cohort.

# File navigation
There are three jupyter notebooks contained in this project: 1. Data Preprocessing, 2. Feature Creation, and 3. Modeling. These should be run in order, with Data Preprocessing and Feature Creation run for each state's data. 
1. Data Preprocessing takes in the raw data from the Medicaid dataset to gather the proper data on our defined cohorts of opioid prescription. Running the file will generate the following:
provider_filter.csv - provider data specific to the opioid prescription cohort
provider_ids.csv - a list of all provider ids in the cohort
common_filter.csv, ind_filter.csv, dx_filter.csv, institutional_filter.csv, rx_filter.csv - patient data pertinent to opioid prescription cohort
opioid_claim_ma_dict - pickled dictionary of opioid claims mapped to the patients unique identifier
opioid_naive_info - pickled dictionary of opioid naive patient identifiers to a list of their opioid rx claims and the corresponding dates, and eligibility periods of initial rx
mas_to_opioid_rx - pickled dict of mas to their opioid claim numbers
opioid_rx_mas.csv - opioid claim to ma csv file
opioid_rx_claims - pickled set of opioid claims
full_claim_ma_dict - all claims for all ma's with opioid rx hx

2. Feature Creation takes in the files created in the data preprocessing file and generates a table of features for modeling. Running the file will generate the following:
init_opioid_features - pandas dataframe with the unique identifier, chronic identifier, and array of features for modeling.

3. Modeling takes the dataframe generated by feature creation and runs some statistics and generates several predictive models from these features.
